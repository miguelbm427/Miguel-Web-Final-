                CUNY is home to one of the largest Latino communities in the country. The Mexican American Student
                Association (M.A.S.A) was founded one year ago by fellow students to celebrate and support Latino
                culture at BMCC. Our goal is to break the stereotype that community college is a lonely experience by
                creating a welcoming space where students from diverse backgrounds can come together, connect, and
                unwind.
